BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage\nsystems, and offer services related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our\ncustomer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops,\nSupercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance,\nattractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to\ndevelop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through\ncontinuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our\nengineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\nSegment Information\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully\nelectric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and\nother, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging,\ninsurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design,\nmanufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of\nsolar energy systems incentives.\nOur Products and Services\nAutomotive\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door\nmid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility\nvehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and\nModel X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance\ncharacteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we entered the consumer\npickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has\nthe utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned\nelectric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving\n(“FSD”) (Supervised) features, including through our purpose-built Robotaxi product - Cybercab, and battery cell and other\ntechnologies. For purposes of this filing, use of the term “FSD (Supervised)” includes the equivalent naming convention, “FSD\n(Capability)” that is used in the European, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Products\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to\ncustomers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an\nenergy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped\ntogether to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater capacity.\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems\nacross a wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\n2\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n6/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSolar Energy Offerings\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit\nsolar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture\ncertain components for our solar energy products.\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, to consumers, including through\nchannel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real\nestate developers and builders on new homes.\nTechnology\nAutomotive\nBattery and Powertrain\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design\nvehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be\nadaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor\npowertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as\nwell as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of\nModel S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body\nof knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for\nour products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved\nmanufacturing processes.\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software.

The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins, along with vehicles returned\nupon lease-end are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties.\nPublic Charging\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers.\nWhere possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable\npower. Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle\nowners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger\nnetwork either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer\nSupercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to\nsustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American\nCharging Standard (NACS). This enables electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier\nand more efficient for everyone and advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this,\nall major automotive companies announced their adoption of NACS in certain markets, with their access to the Supercharger\nnetwork beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no later than 2025. We also engaged SAE\nInternational to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our network of\nTesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting\nemployees, to offer additional charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family\nresidential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\nIn-App Upgrades\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and\nfeatures through the Tesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer\ncertain options and features on a subscription basis in the future.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities\nthrough a variety of channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel\npartners, and in the case of some commercial customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and\naccessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\nService and Warranty\nAutomotive\nService\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service\ntechnicians who perform work remotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to\nidentify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer\nnetworks.

In order to enable a greater supply of cells for\nour products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved\nmanufacturing processes.\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control\nsystems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions.\nWe develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly\nthrough over-the-air updates.\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily visionbased technologies. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer\nhardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural\nnetworks for real-world performance.\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) options.\nAlthough at present, same as in the past, the driver is responsible for remaining fully engaged in the driving operation, our systems\nprovide safety and convenience functionality that can relieve drivers of many tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road\ntravel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these\nfunctions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air software updates.\nIn 2025, we intend to begin launching our Robotaxi business, a ride-hailing network that will eventually operate fully\nautonomous vehicles. We expect this business will open access to a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve. We\nbelieve our capabilities and advancements in AI, including the deployment of Cortex, our training cluster at Gigafactory Texas,\ndifferentiates us from our competitors.\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as\nthrough Optimus, a robotic humanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\n3\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n7/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Products\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a\nmodular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products.\nAdditionally, our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing\nfast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our\nenergy storage systems.\nSolar Energy Systems\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation.\nThe efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics\ntechnologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall.\nDesign and Engineering\nAutomotive\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their\ncomponents and systems. Our team has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash\ntest simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in\nstamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without\nseparate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and\nproduction for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As\nwe increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the\nsimulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install\nenergy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular\ndesign of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field.\nWe also customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet\ntheir specific needs.\nSales and Marketing\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We\ncontinue to monitor our public narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in\ncustomer education and advertising as necessary.\nAutomotive\nDirect Sales\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some\njurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the\nsale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing,\neducate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain\nrapid customer feedback.\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales\nchannels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to\nvolatility from time to time.\n4\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-202\n######################\nOutput:",

Model Y is a compact sport utility\nvehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and\nModel X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance\ncharacteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we entered the consumer\npickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has\nthe utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned\nelectric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving\n(“FSD”) (Supervised) features, including through our purpose-built Robotaxi product - Cybercab, and battery cell and other\ntechnologies. For purposes of this filing, use of the term “FSD (Supervised)” includes the equivalent naming convention, “FSD\n(Capability)” that is used in the European, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Products\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to\ncustomers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an\nenergy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped\ntogether to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater capacity.\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems\nacross a wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\n2\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n6/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSolar Energy Offerings\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit\nsolar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture\ncertain components for our solar energy products.\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, to consumers, including through\nchannel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real\nestate developers and builders on new homes.\nTechnology\nAutomotive\nBattery and Powertrain\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design\nvehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be\nadaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor\npowertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as\nwell as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of\nModel S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body\nof knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for\nour products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved\nmanufacturing processes.\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software.

In order to enable a greater supply of cells for\nour products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved\nmanufacturing processes.\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control\nsystems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions.\nWe develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly\nthrough over-the-air updates.\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily visionbased technologies. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer\nhardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural\nnetworks for real-world performance.\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) options.\nAlthough at present, same as in the past, the driver is responsible for remaining fully engaged in the driving operation, our systems\nprovide safety and convenience functionality that can relieve drivers of many tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road\ntravel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these\nfunctions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air software updates.\nIn 2025, we intend to begin launching our Robotaxi business, a ride-hailing network that will eventually operate fully\nautonomous vehicles. We expect this business will open access to a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve. We\nbelieve our capabilities and advancements in AI, including the deployment of Cortex, our training cluster at Gigafactory Texas,\ndifferentiates us from our competitors.\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as\nthrough Optimus, a robotic humanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\n3\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n7/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Products\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a\nmodular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products.\nAdditionally, our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing\nfast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our\nenergy storage systems.\nSolar Energy Systems\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation.\nThe efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics\ntechnologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall.\nDesign and Engineering\nAutomotive\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their\ncomponents and systems. Our team has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash\ntest simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in\nstamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without\nseparate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and\nproduction for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As\nwe increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the\nsimulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install\nenergy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular\ndesign of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field.\nWe also customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet\ntheir specific needs.\nSales and Marketing\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We\ncontinue to monitor our public narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in\ncustomer education and advertising as necessary.\nAutomotive\nDirect Sales\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some\njurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the\nsale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing,\neducate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain\nrapid customer feedback.\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales\nchannels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to\nvolatility from time to time.\n4\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-202\n######################\nOutput:",

The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins, along with vehicles returned\nupon lease-end are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties.\nPublic Charging\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers.\nWhere possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable\npower. Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle\nowners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger\nnetwork either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer\nSupercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to\nsustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American\nCharging Standard (NACS). This enables electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier\nand more efficient for everyone and advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this,\nall major automotive companies announced their adoption of NACS in certain markets, with their access to the Supercharger\nnetwork beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no later than 2025. We also engaged SAE\nInternational to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our network of\nTesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting\nemployees, to offer additional charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family\nresidential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\nIn-App Upgrades\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and\nfeatures through the Tesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer\ncertain options and features on a subscription basis in the future.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities\nthrough a variety of channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel\npartners, and in the case of some commercial customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and\naccessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\nService and Warranty\nAutomotive\nService\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service\ntechnicians who perform work remotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to\nidentify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer\nnetworks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively.\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\nWe provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to consumers, which may\ninclude limited warranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer\noptional extended service plans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified\nregions.\n5\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n9/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nWe provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally\nprovide manufacturer’s limited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that are\navailable at the time of purchase of the system. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation\nworkmanship.\nFor retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for\nSolar Roof, we also provide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we\ngenerally pass-through the applicable manufacturers’ warranties.\nAs part of our historical solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance\nguarantees that commit that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance\nrequirements specified in the contract.\nFinancial Services\nAutomotive\nPurchase Financing and Leases\nWe offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe\nand/or Asia ourselves and through various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value\nguarantees or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to cover a resale\n######################\nOutput:",
