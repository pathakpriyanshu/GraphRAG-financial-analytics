We also\nrely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating\nresults relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable\nmacroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the\nexistence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future\nresults considering all available information.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable,\nwe believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued\ninterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by\ncertain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI\ninclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred\nmethod, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income\n(loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been\nexcluded from the determination of net income.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to\nmeasure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with\nonly service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected\nvolatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant\ndate based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an\nemployee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for\nstock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net\nof actual forfeitures in the period.\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance\nachievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone\nbecomes probable.\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our\ncommon stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation\nof our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based\ncompensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative\nexpense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n59\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n65/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under\ncertain funding arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under\noperating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing\narrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the\nhypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and\nredeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is\npresented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in\nsubsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in\nthe consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under\nthe liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in\naccordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties’\ninterests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking\ninto account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest\nbalance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity\nin the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the\nfunds for cash or other assets.\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a publicly traded company that provides electric vehicles, solar energy systems, and other innovative technologies.
