Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic\nand Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited\nnumber of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our\nsuppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from\nour suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more\ncost-effective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and\nmay continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the\ntimeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are\n15\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n19/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nunable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from\nsuppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\nIn addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part\nupon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials\nfluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For\nexample, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw\nmaterials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our\ntimelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these\nmaterials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot\nrecoup such costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our\nbrand, growth, prospects and operating results.\nOur future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles\nin an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.\nThough we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general\nand Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles\ndecreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results\nmay be harmed.\nIn addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our\nvehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:\n•\n\nperceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\n\n•\n\nperceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to\ncharging facilities;\n\n•\n\ncompetition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicles;\n\n•\n\nvolatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;\n\n•\n\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\n\n•\n\nconcerns about our future viability.\n\nThe target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be\ncyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility. We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current\nglobal trends or their sustained impact on consumer demand. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to\nremain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure\nrequirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Rising interest rates may lead to\nconsumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and operating\nresults. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is\ncommensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nWe face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. A\nsignificant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are\nreported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully\nelectric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some\ncases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced\nan intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. In addition, certain government and economic\nincentives which provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically or have local suppliers, may provide a greater\nbenefit to our competitors, which could negatively impact our profitability. Many of our competitors have significantly more or\nbetter-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and\nsupport of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls,\nloss of customers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a leading electric vehicle and energy storage company that relies on suppliers for battery cells and faces challenges related to raw material availability, market demand, and competition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANASONIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Panasonic is a supplier of battery cells for Tesla's vehicles and energy storage products)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTEMPORARY AMPEREX TECHNOLOGY CO.
