Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and\ninternal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuit has been stayed pending resolution of a motion to\nconsolidate certain derivative lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery referenced below.\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging\nbreach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. Tesla denied any\nwrongdoing and filed multiple counterclaims. On November 27, 2024, the parties agreed to settle their claims.\nCertain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware\nBefore converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024, three separate derivative actions brought by\npurported Tesla stockholders were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, purportedly on\nbehalf of Tesla, against current and former directors regarding topics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter)\nand x.AI. These suits assert various claims, including breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract, and seek unspecified\ndamages and other relief. On August 6, 2024, the plaintiffs in these three actions moved to consolidate the matters into a single\ncase. The Court consolidated two of the three cases.\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\nOn February 9, 2022, the California Civil Rights Department (“CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against\nTesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay\nequity claims, among others. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently in\ndiscovery. Trial is scheduled for September 15, 2025.\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against\nTesla that closely parallels the CRD’s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking,\namong other things, monetary and injunctive relief.\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District\nof Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach\nof fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender\ndiscrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages\npayable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs\nfiled a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on September 15,\n2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed\nan amended complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to\ndismiss the amended complaint, which the Court granted on April 12, 2024, with leave for plaintiffs to amend. On May 15, 2024,\nplaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk. On July 1, 2024, the\ndefendants moved to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint.\n86\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n93/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nOther Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class\nactions and other consumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products\nand services. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the\nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company’s driver assistance\ntechnology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a\nConsolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons\nwho purchased or leased from\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_bc3401d75cb915cf6d7f6faa1d3b737fe8a17613ba09143e7fae58728f59bc3d_v2"}
