We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts\nthat are collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective\ncustomer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was not material as of December 31, 2024 and\n2023.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to\nresidential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and smallscale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small-scale\ncommercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation\nobligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by\nthe utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers\nconsist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product\nhas been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is\nmade upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\n56\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n62/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nFor certain large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and\ninstallation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project.\nRevenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a\npercentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the\nvarious obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated\nbased on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to\ncommissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to energy\nstorage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.\nAs part of certain energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant\nthat the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an\nenergy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages.\nOther forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include\nvariable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable\ncustomer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount\nand updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in\nthe transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are primarily related to prepayments from customers, which\nis recognized as revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred\nrevenue related to such customer payments amounted to $1.77 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual\npayment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.27 billion and\n$571 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit\ndisclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage\nsales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that\namount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated\nto performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than\none year was $7.18 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $4.51 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the\nremaining performance obligation period.\nWe have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy\nproducts. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $34 million and $31 million,\nrespectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $658 million and $578 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the longterm portion.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage\nproducts, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such\nsystems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The\ndifference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have\ndetermined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized\nbased on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_84f20322a74ba8d6a09bc66e6c42b01075fc181759d76eba6cf27534827dfabb_v2"}
