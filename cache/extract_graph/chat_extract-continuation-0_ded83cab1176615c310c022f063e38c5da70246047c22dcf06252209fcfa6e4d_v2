This incentive is recorded as a\nreduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated\nstatements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the grant funding related to property taxes paid\nwere immaterial.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k)\nof the Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating\nemployees may elect to contribute up to 90% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January\n2022, we began to match 50% of each employee’s contributions up to a maximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee’s\neligible compensation, vested upon one year of service. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized\n$107 million, $99 million and $91 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.\n2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting\nentity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a\nprospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial\nstatements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will likely result in the required additional\ndisclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40).\nThe ASU requires the disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee\ncompensation, depreciation, and amortization, within relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires disclosure of the\ntotal amount of selling expenses along with the definition of selling expenses. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Adoption of this ASU can\neither be applied prospectively to consolidated financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU\nor retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted.\nThis ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once\nadopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280).\nThis ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses\nthat are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a\nsegment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and\ndeciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted this ASU retrospectively on December 31, 2024.
