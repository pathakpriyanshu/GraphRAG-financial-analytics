Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to\nreplace items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs\nof future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with\nrespect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes\nthan our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and\nother claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance\ncoverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have\nmay include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our\ninsurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy\nlimits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant\nrestrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among\nother things, incur additional debt or create liens. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain\namount of liquidity. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and\nengage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to\ncomply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate\nour obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.\nAdditional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them.\nOur business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows\nmay fluctuate substantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity,\nequity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources\nof liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or\naccelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if\nnot required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on\nfavorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of\noperations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.\nWe depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or\nmanufacturing technology may change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more\nquickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our\nability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the\nproduction of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or\nadditional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the\ndepreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.\nThere is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not\nincur additional indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $7.91 billion in aggregate principal amount of\nindebtedness (see Note 10, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and\nour subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure\nexisting or future debt or recapitalize our debt.\n22\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n26/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, or to refinance our\nindebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive\nand other factors beyond our control.
