While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-production and sale,\nthere may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to\nor installation for customers.\n17\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n21/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such\nclaims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers,\nour vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and\nsuch accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD (Supervised) features are engaged are the subject of significant public\nattention, especially in light of NHTSA’s Standing General Order requiring reports regarding certain crashes involving vehicles\nwith advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny\narising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering.\nIn addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release\nthe energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells.\nWhile we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring\ncells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur,\nin particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store\nelectricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to\nlawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend\nit, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to\nbe paid from company funds and not by insurance.\nWe will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers,\nanalysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such\nconfidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with\nour products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand;\ncompetition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production\nand sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In\nparticular, Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to\nsignificant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or\nunfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions,\nwhether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.\nWe may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to,\nour various financing programs.\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through\nvarious financial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in\ncertain markets. Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases\ndirectly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease,\nfollowed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar\nenergy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity\ngenerated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations\nand consumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately\nproject our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms\ndepending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles, legislative changes and the pricing\nof new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the\nordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing\nprogram. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If\nwe are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling\nalternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to\ngrow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot\neffectively\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3810542f9c606318ec66673e14c720b84619c329a42465c60b9a883cadc1e4ba_v2"}
