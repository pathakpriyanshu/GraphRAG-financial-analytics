MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the\nrelated notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of our products and services,\ntechnology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1- Business. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the\nresults of operations for fiscal year 2023-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023, which was filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission on January 29, 2024.\nOverview and 2024 Highlights\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell\nhigh-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance,\ninstallation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly\nfocused on products and services based on AI, robotics and automation.\nIn 2024, we produced approximately 1,773,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 1,789,000 consumer\nvehicles. We are focused on profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and\nmore affordable products, further improving and deploying our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including future autonomous\ncapabilities through our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab, reducing costs, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity\nand delivery capabilities, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our\nsupply chain, and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\nIn 2024, we deployed 31.4 GWh of energy storage products. We are focused on ramping the production and increasing the\nmarket penetration of our energy storage products.\nIn 2024, we recognized total revenues of $97.69 billion, representing an increase of $917 million compared to the prior year.\nIn 2024, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $7.09 billion, representing a decrease of $7.91 billion compared\nto the prior year, primarily due to the impact of releasing $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with U.S. federal and\nstate deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023.We continue to ramp production and build and optimize our manufacturing\ncapacity, expand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries\nand deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software, and fleet-based profits for\nfurther revenue growth.\nWe ended 2024 with $36.56 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $7.47 billion\nfrom the end of 2023. Our cash flows provided by operating activities were $14.92 billion in 2024 compared to $13.26 billion in\n2023, representing an increase of $1.67 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $11.34 billion in 2024 compared to $8.90 billion\nin 2023, representing an increase of $2.44 billion. Overall growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will\ncontinue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and development in upcoming periods.\n32\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n36/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook\nAutomotive—Production\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under\ndevelopment, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nRegion\n\nVehicle Model(s)\n\nProduction Status\n\nCalifornia\n\nModel S / Model X\nModel 3 / Model Y\nModel 3 / Model Y\n\nActive\nActive\nActive\n\nModel Y\nModel Y\nCybertruck\nCybercab\nTesla Semi\nRoadster\n\nActive\nActive\nActive\nIn development\nPilot production\nIn development\n\nShanghai\nBerlin\nTexas\n\nNevada\nTBD\n\nWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing newer vehicle models\nsuch as our Cybertruck, Tesla Semi and future vehicles utilizing aspects of our next generation platform, and ramping the\nproduction at our Gigafactories to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and efficiency at our\ncurrent factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and be initiated by\nadvances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform, as well\nas our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have\nhigh-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease\nproduction costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be\nexacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9dc75ae84363b4c46277043b0fd1531f700599e509dbf79a67e840e580813a24_v2"}
