AI infrastructure includes\nour owned data centers.\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are\nremoved from the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations.\nMaintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or\nexpected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be\nrecoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is\nexpected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years\nended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from\nseven to thirty years.\nGoodwill\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill.\n64\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n70/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nCapitalization of Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to\nProperty, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and postimplementation activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life\nof three to five years.\nSoftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred\nsubsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when\nthey are expected to become significant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is\nmade generally available to our customers.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nwe have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.\nForeign Currency\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions\nbased on the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a\ncumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet.\nFor each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end\nfunctional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated\nin currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other\nincome (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we\nrecorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $57 million, gain of $122 million and loss of $89 million, respectively.\nWarranties\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of\nthe energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for\nthe products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and\nrecalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs\nof future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause\nmaterial changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated\nwith our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to\nrepair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next\n12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we\nrecord receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses\nand other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.
