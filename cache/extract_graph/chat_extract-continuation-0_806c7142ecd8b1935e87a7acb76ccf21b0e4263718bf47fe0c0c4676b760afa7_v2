If we are unable to accurately\nmatch the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory\nmanagement and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur\nunexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\nWe may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may\nexperience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local\nsupply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future\nfactories. The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject\n14\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n18/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nto a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory\nrequirements, procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional\nexpansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production\nequipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale. Moreover, we will have to establish\nand ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate\nsequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays\nin meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing\nteams to implement iterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing\nthat we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects,\noperating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle\ncharging networks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.\nOur success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting a global mass\ndemographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and\npricing our products. We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific\ndemand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles\nthat we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region. Likewise, as we\ndevelop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand\nin various markets.\nBecause we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers.\nAs our production volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing\nvolumes, particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery\nmodels, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models\nwill be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to substantially increase our\nproduction and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial\ncondition and operating results may be harmed.\nMoreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by\ncertain authorized professionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or\nexperience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3\nand Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles\nalso requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle\ncharging targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or\ncoverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments\nand management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that\nwe will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As we expand, we will also need to\nensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our\nproducts, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to manage\nour growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and\nmanufacture of our own cells, and control our related costs.\nWe are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we\nwill require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic\nand Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited\nnumber of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our\nsuppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products.
