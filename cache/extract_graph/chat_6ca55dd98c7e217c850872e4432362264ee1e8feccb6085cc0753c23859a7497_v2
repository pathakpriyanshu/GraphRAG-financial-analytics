Our effective tax rate changed to an expense of 20% in the year ended December 31, 2024\nfrom a benefit of 50% in the year ended December 31, 2023. These changes are primarily due to the impact of releasing the\nvaluation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In the\nfourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income\nin recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it\nis more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable and released $6.54 billion of\nour valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, we continue to conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax\nassets are realizable, except for our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses.\nSee Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor further details.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow. The cash we generate from our core operations enables\nus to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including\nour proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future\nfactories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including\nto support NACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will\nbe able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing\noperations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may\nchoose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may\ndecide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including\nthrough drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that\nit is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\n41\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n45/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period\nfollowing December 31, 2024, as well as in the long-term.\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of\nliquidity to meet such needs.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components\nand raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise\ngrowth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have\nbinding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase\norders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook—\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to\nsupport our projects globally to exceed $11.00 billion in 2025 and in each of the following two fiscal years.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $7.91 billion in aggregate principal amount of\nindebtedness, of which $2.35 billion is current. As of December 31, 2024, our total minimum lease payments was $7.05 billion, of\nwhich $1.19 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note\n10, Debt, and Note 11, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\nOur sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used\nvehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products, interest income, and proceeds from debt facilities and equity\nofferings, when applicable.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $16.14 billion and $20.42 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $2.90 billion and consisted primarily\nof euros and Chinese yuan. We had $5.00 billion of unused committed credit amounts as of December 31, 202\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6ca55dd98c7e217c850872e4432362264ee1e8feccb6085cc0753c23859a7497_v2"}
