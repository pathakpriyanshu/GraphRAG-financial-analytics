We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account\nall relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider\nour history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional\nbasis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the\ntiming of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of\nbusiness operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of\nour common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future\ntaxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation\nallowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\n36\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n40/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are\nmany transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this\nuncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized\nwhen, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those\npositions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and\nvarious foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions.\nSuch returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our\ntax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors,\nincluding past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and\ncircumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the\nfinal tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in\nwhich such determination is made.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nAutomotive sales\n\n$\n\n72,480\n\n2023\n\n$\n\n2024 vs. 2023 Change\n\n2022\n\n78,509\n\n$\n\n67,210\n\n$\n\n$\n\n%\n\n(6,029)\n\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\n$\n\n(8)% $\n\n%\n\n11,299\n\n17 %\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits\n\n2,763\n\n1,790\n\n1,776\n\n973\n\n54 %\n\n14\n\n1%\n\nAutomotive leasing\n\n1,827\n\n2,120\n\n2,476\n\n(293)\n\n(14)%\n\n(356)\n\n(14)%\n\n77,070\n\n82,419\n\n71,462\n\n(5,349)\n\n(6)%\n\n10,957\n\n15 %\n\n10,534\n\n8,319\n\n6,091\n\n2,215\n\n27 %\n\n2,228\n\n37 %\n\n87,604\n\n90,738\n\n77,553\n\n(3,134)\n\n(3)%\n\n13,185\n\n17 %\n\n4,051\n\n67 %\n\n2,126\n\n54 %\n\n1% $\n\n15,311\n\n19 %\n\nTotal automotive revenues\nServices and other\nTotal automotive & services and other\nsegment revenue\nEnergy generation and storage segment\nrevenue\nTotal revenues\n\n10,086\n$\n\n97,690\n\n6,035\n$\n\n96,773\n\n3,909\n$\n\n81,462\n\n$\n\n917\n\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, including access to our\nFSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air\nsoftware updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from\nautomotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We\nmonetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close\nas possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements.\nAdditionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated\nwith the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales,\npaid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.\n2024 compared to 2023\nAutomotive sales revenue decreased $6.03 billion, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions and\nattractive financing options provided in 2024 as well as mix. Additionally, there was a decrease of approximately 22,000 combined\nModel 3 and Model Y cash deliveries. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately 19,000 deliveries of\nother models primarily due to our production\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e126be13b59894804995dba5877162c077841cfca7212d40a82de1e1d189b949_v2"}
