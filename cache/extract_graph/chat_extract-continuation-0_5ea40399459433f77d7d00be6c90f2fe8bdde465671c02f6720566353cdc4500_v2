We compete\nwith these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products,\nour strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\nSolar Energy Systems\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our\npotential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers\ncan switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide\nproducts and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide\nfinancing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory\nenvironment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\nIntellectual Property\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness\nto our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations\nand designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures,\nincluding through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a\nhigh priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our\ninnovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have\nalso adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our\npatents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made\nthis pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting\nourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\nESG\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world\ncannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and\nmanufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new\nfactory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one, including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and\nresource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing sustainability of operations outside\nof our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of\nmanagement systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to\ndemonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child\nor forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find\nways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our incidents per\nvehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering\ncompelling, impactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.\n10\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n14/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We\ncontinue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the\ncompany and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics. Our Sustainability and Impact team, in\nconjunction with leaders from across our Company, regularly presents to our Board of Directors, which oversees our ESG impacts,\ninitiatives and priorities.\nHuman Capital Resources\nTesla’s ability to attract, develop and retain a talented workforce is a competitive advantage. During the past year, Tesla\nprovided its workforce with opportunities to contribute to its mission and grow professionally, earning Tesla among the Top 100\nEmployers of Choice in the 2024 American Opportunity Index. As of December 31, 2024, our employee headcount worldwide was\n125,665.\nEmployees can participate in Tesla stock ownership programs (of which 92% have been given the opportunity to as part of\ntheir total rewards package), while accessing industry-leading benefits, such as free counseling, paid parental leave, paid time off,\ncompany sponsored 401(k) plans, no cost fertility and adoption programs and zero-premium medical plan options that are made\navailable on the first day of employment.\nWe hire, evaluate and promote employees based on their skills and performance.
