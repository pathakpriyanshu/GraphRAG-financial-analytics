The ongoing\nrequests for information include topics such as operations, technology (e.g., vehicle functionality, vehicle incidents, Autopilot and\nFSD Capability), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla’s business, its personnel, and related parties.\nWe routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our\nknowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict\nthe outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the\npossibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business\nactivities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated\ndata including, purportedly non-public Tesla business and personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected\nindividuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and we are working with certain law enforcement and other\nauthorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that\neach assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development\nwere to occur in these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact\non our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $448 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\nNote 15 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy\nsystems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets\ninto various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the\nprimary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810. We have considered the\nprovisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs,\nincluding determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs,\nredeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors\nunder the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated\nin the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses,\nestimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our\nsubsidiary as specified in the agreements.\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market\nvalue of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements.\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to\nthe funds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances,\nwe have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of the funds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations.\n88\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n95/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nThe aggregate carrying values of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and\nbalances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n\nDecember 31,\n2023\n\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n$\n\n49\n\n$\n\n66\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n18\n\n13\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n\n276\n\n361\n\n343\n\n440\n\nTotal current assets\nOperating lease vehicles, net\n\n392\n\n—\n\nSolar energy systems, net\n\n2,310\n\n3,278\n\nOther non-current assets\n\n183\n\n369\n\nTotal assets\n\n$\n\n3,228\n\n$\n\n4,087\n\n$\n\n32\n\n$\n\n67\n\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nAccrued liabilities and other\nDeferred revenue\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases\nTotal current liabilities\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion\nDebt and finance leases,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a multinational corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage, and solar energy systems.
