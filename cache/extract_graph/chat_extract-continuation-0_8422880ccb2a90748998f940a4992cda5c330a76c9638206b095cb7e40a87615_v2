Compliance\nwith any current or future legal requirements on these topics may result in additional costs or risks to us, including harm to our\nreputation, reduction in customer demand, and increased legal and operational risks.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health\nepidemics.\nWe may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate\nchange, power outages or other events outside of our control. For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are\nlocated in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone\narea. Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located experienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021\nthat had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation. If major disasters such as earthquakes, floods or other climate-related\nevents occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production\nfacilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. Also, the broader\nconsequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and\ngeopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory\naction by the Russian government against companies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be\npredicted. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Government Laws and Regulations\nDemand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting\nthe development and adoption of such products.\nGovernment and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad,\nincluding certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For\nexample, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily\nunavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. In addition,\ncertain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended to provide benefits to manufacturers who\nassemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such developments could\nnegatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing\nmodifications.\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect\nto our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and\ninvestors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted,\nreduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where\nnet metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems\ngenerate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been or has been\nproposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested\nbefore the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business,\nprospects, financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of\ncapital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy\nstorage assets.\nFinally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on\nindependently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems. Some governmental authorities have audited\nsuch values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such\ndeterminations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our\nfunds or fund investors.\nWe are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable\nchanges upon our operations or products.\nOur business operations are and will continue to be subject to complex environmental, occupational, health and safety laws\nand regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to\nthe use, handling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials,\n24\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n28/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nproduct material inputs and post-consumer products and with respect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities.\nNew, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a global company focused on accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy through electric vehicles, solar products, and energy storage solutions.
