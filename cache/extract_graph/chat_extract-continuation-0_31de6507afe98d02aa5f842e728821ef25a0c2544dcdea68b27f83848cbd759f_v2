Realized gains and losses on\nthe sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the\nconsideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the\nrespective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies\noffering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to\nother automotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against\naccounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when\nthey are deemed uncollectible.\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate\nas we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our\nfinancing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our\naccounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment\nterms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are\ndependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending\non the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant\nimpact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, government rebates\nreceivable was $315 million and $378 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and an immaterial\namount and $207 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinancing Receivables\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at\namortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to\nmaintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In\ndetermining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. Interest income on financing receivables is recognized\nover the loan term as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau\ninformation (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness\nfocusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio\nhave strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis.\nFor all financing receivables, we define “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past\nthe contractual due date. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status\nwith an immaterial balance being past due. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our financing receivables,\nexcluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022.\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the\noption to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The\noutstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a\ncomponent of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term\nportion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance\nfor expected credit losses, was $248 million and $266 million, respectively, of which $4 million and $5 million were due in the\nnext 12 months as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for expected\ncredit losses was $33 million and $36 million, respectively.\n62\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n68/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nConcentration of Risk\nCredit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents,\ninvestments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on\ndeposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in highly rated, investment-grade securities.
