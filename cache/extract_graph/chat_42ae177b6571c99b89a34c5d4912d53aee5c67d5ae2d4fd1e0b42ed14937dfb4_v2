We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission\nstandards and other regulatory requirements.\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in\naccordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits,\nwhich have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the\npurchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and\n2023. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was immaterial for the years\nended December 31, 2024 and 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288 million in revenue\ndue to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. We have elected the practical\nexpedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts\nwith an original expected contract length of one year or less. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to\nperformance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than\none year was $4.68 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $863 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the\nremaining performance obligation period. Additionally, changes in regulations on automotive regulatory credits may significantly\nimpact our remaining performance obligations and revenue to be recognized under these contracts.\n55\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n61/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries\nin Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease\nterm, customers may opt to return the vehicles to us or purchase the vehicles when contractually permitted. We account for these\nleasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the\ncontractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.78 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.75 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had deferred $394 million and $458 million, respectively, of lease-related\nupfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases\nunder ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Our arrangements under these programs can have\nterms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue\nand automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the\nimplicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $12 million, $215 million and $683 million, respectively, of salestype leasing revenue and $7 million, $164 million and $427 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\nServices and Other Revenue\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales,\npaid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided\nand extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a standready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately\nand thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with\nother performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are typically received at\nthe point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments\nreceived for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Accrued\nliabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts\nthat are collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective\ncustomer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was not material as of December 31, 2024 and\n2023.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to\nres\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_42ae177b6571c99b89a34c5d4912d53aee5c67d5ae2d4fd1e0b42ed14937dfb4_v2"}
