We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n46\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n50/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain\nto the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets\nof the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive\nsegment, was $6,716 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used\nTesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management’s best estimate of the projected\ncosts to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date\nand an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain\nTesla vehicle models; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\nmanagement’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models;\nand, (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement’s estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management’s\nsignificant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of\nactual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of\nhistorical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation of future\nclaims and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of\nmanagement’s estimate by (a) developing an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle\nmodels and (b) comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimate. Developing the independent estimate involved\nevaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects of management’s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of\nfuture claims.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 29, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\n47\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n51/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTesla, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in millions, except per share data)\nDecember 31,\n2024\n\nDecember 31,\n2023\n\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n$\n\n16,139\n\n$\n\n16,398\n\nShort-term investments\n\n20,424\n\n12,696\n\nAccounts receivable, net\nInventory\n\n4,418\n12,017\n\n3,508\n13,626\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n\n5,362\n\n3,388\n\nTotal current assets\n\n58,360\n\n49,616\n\nOperating lease vehicles, net\n\n5,581\n\n5,989\n\nSolar energy systems, net\n\n4,924\n\n5,229\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n35,836\n\n29,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA, INC.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla, Inc. is an automotive and energy company that manufactures electric vehicles, solar energy systems, and other products.
