Our cash and investments balances are primarily on\ndeposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in highly rated, investment-grade securities. These deposits are\ntypically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables\nbalance.\nSupply Risk\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary\ncomponents of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently\nmanage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition\nand operating results.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and\nenergy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or\nobsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of\nour future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate\nsale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the\ninventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established\nand subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs\nmay be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\nOperating Lease Vehicles\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less\naccumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of\nautomotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2024 and\n2023 was $7.03 billion and $7.36 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented\nnet of accumulated depreciation of $1.45 billion and $1.38 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDigital Assets, Net\nWe account for all digital assets held as crypto assets, a subset of indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC\n350-60, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets. We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may\nuse third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on\nthe consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Periods prior to January 1, 2024 include digital assets at cost, net of impairment losses\nincurred since their acquisition.\nWe determine and record the fair value of our digital assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC\n820”), based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I\ninputs). We determine the cost basis of our digital assets using the specific identification of each unit received. Realized and\nunrealized gains and losses are now recorded to Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\n63\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n69/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nFor periods prior to January 1, 2024, impairment losses were recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated\nstatements of operations in the period in which the impairment was identified. Also for periods prior to January 1, 2024, gains were\nnot recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they were presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets\nheld within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the\nsales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.\nSee Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.\nSolar Energy Systems, Net\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of solar\nenergy systems is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 30 to 35 years. The gross cost of solar\nenergy systems as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $6.79 billion and $6.87 billion, respectively. Solar energy systems on the\nconsolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.86 billion and $1.64 billion as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as\nfollows:\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture\nTooling\n\n3 to 15 years\n4 to 7 years\n\nBuilding and building improvements\nComputer equipment and software\nAI infrastructure\n\n15 to 30 years\n3 to 6 years\n5 to 30 years\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
