In order to enable a greater supply of cells for\nour products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved\nmanufacturing processes.\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control\nsystems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions.\nWe develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly\nthrough over-the-air updates.\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily visionbased technologies. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer\nhardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural\nnetworks for real-world performance.\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) options.\nAlthough at present, same as in the past, the driver is responsible for remaining fully engaged in the driving operation, our systems\nprovide safety and convenience functionality that can relieve drivers of many tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road\ntravel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these\nfunctions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air software updates.\nIn 2025, we intend to begin launching our Robotaxi business, a ride-hailing network that will eventually operate fully\nautonomous vehicles. We expect this business will open access to a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve. We\nbelieve our capabilities and advancements in AI, including the deployment of Cortex, our training cluster at Gigafactory Texas,\ndifferentiates us from our competitors.\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as\nthrough Optimus, a robotic humanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\n3\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n7/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Products\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a\nmodular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products.\nAdditionally, our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing\nfast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our\nenergy storage systems.\nSolar Energy Systems\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation.\nThe efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics\ntechnologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall.\nDesign and Engineering\nAutomotive\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their\ncomponents and systems. Our team has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash\ntest simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in\nstamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without\nseparate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and\nproduction for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As\nwe increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the\nsimulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install\nenergy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular\ndesign of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field.\nWe also customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet\ntheir specific needs.\nSales and Marketing\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We\ncontinue to monitor our public narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in\ncustomer education and advertising as necessary.\nAutomotive\nDirect Sales\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some\njurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the\nsale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing,\neducate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain\nrapid customer feedback.\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales\nchannels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to\nvolatility from time to time.\n4\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-202\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8026f6bb978bc0a6c67b65c4ee9e2e8bc7bdf8f1a2d116db37e2ffa144bb1899_v2"}
