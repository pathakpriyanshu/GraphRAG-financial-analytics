(“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003 and\nconverted to a Texas corporation on June 13, 2024. We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric\nvehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts\nand operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of\nASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary.\nWe have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and\nmonetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The\ntypical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a\ncontrolling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting\ninterests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the\nVIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nWe do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary.\nWe have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 15, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We\nevaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying\nnotes. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee\narrangements, sales return reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income taxes, the collectability of accounts and finance\nreceivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value\nand residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the\nimpact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or\nmaterially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThese estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from\nthese estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the accompanying notes.\n53\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n59/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue by source\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n\nAutomotive sales\n\n$\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits\nEnergy generation and storage sales\nServices and other\nTotal revenues from sales and services\nAutomotive leasing\nEnergy generation and storage leasing\nTotal revenues\n\n$\n\n2023\n\n72,480\n2,763\n9,564\n10,534\n\n$\n\n2022\n\n78,509\n1,790\n5,515\n8,319\n\n$\n\n67,210\n1,776\n3,376\n6,091\n\n95,341\n\n94,133\n\n78,453\n\n1,827\n522\n\n2,120\n520\n\n2,476\n533\n\n97,690\n\n$\n\n96,773\n\n$\n\n81,462\n\nAutomotive Segment\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other\nfeatures and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD(Supervised)\nfeatures and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We\nrecognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments\nare typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we\nfinance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term.
