This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a\nConsolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons\nwho purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022, a proposed class action\ncomplaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims\nagainst the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On\nNovember 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On August 8, 2024, the Court denied the\nplaintiff’s motion for leave to file an amended complaint and entered judgment for Tesla. On September 5, 2024, the plaintiff filed\na notice of appeal to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the parties are briefing the matter. On March 22,\n2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order\nTesla to (1) cease using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD\nCapability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed courtfindings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30,\n2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the\nclaims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District\nof California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla moved to dismiss, and on May 15, 2024, the Court granted in part\nand denied in part Tesla’s motion. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior\nCourt in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal\ncourt granted Tesla’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Tesla moved to\ncompel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and on June 27, 2024, the Court stayed the case pending arbitration.\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\nagainst Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made\nmaterial misrepresentations and omissions about the Company’s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money\ndamages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019, and February 17, 2023. An\namended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023,\nTesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On September 30, 2024, the Court granted Tesla’s motion to dismiss without\nprejudice. On November 26, 2024, the court issued a final judgment in Tesla’s favor, and on December 23, 2024, the plaintiffs filed\na notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof California. Several similar complaints were also filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These\ncomplaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and\nseeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from\nMarch 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the\ncourt granted Tesla’s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted Tesla’s\nmotion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12, 2023, which\nTesla moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs also appealed the court’s arbitration order, which was denied. On June 17, 2024, the Court\ngranted in part and denied in part Tesla’s motion to dismiss the Consolidated Second Amended Complaint.\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We\nare unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\n87\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n94/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\nWe
