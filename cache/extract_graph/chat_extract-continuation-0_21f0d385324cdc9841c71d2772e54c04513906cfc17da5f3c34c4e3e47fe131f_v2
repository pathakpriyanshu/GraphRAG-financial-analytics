Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value\nguarantees or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to cover a resale loss up to a certain limit or repurchase the subject vehicles\nat pre-determined values.\nInsurance\nIn 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often\nbetter than other alternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan to\nexpand the markets in which we offer insurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for\nour customers.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nWe offer certain financing options to our residential customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own energy\nsystems comprised of solar, Solar Roof and/or Powerwall batteries. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers,\ncharge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems.\nManufacturing\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in California, New York, Texas and Nevada. At these facilities, we\nmanufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain vehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and\nbattery cells, energy storage components and systems and solar products and components.\nInternationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China and Germany, which allows us to increase the affordability of\nour vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of\nunfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we\ncontinue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our\nsignificant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing.\nSupply Chain\nOur products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close\nrelationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components\npurchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing\nefficiencies from economies of scale.\n6\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n10/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single\nsuppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where\nit is sensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by\nmaintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these\nmaterials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and\ndemand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when\nfeasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and\npolicies. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See\nNote 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for further details.\nPrograms and Incentives\nInflation Reduction Act\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years\nbeginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to\npromote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax\ncredits to consumers. For example, under current legislation, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax\ncredits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles\n(“ZEVs”), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to\ncomply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive\nregulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnergy Storage System Incentives and Policies\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and\nfinancial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S.\nfederal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the\nparticipation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a global company involved in automotive manufacturing, energy generation and storage, insurance, and financial services.
