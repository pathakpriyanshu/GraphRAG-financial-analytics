Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient\nto satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital\nexpenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing\nor delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may\nbe onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our\nfinancial condition at such time. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by\nagreements governing our future indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which\nmay result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue,\noperating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent we have\nsignificant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our\nrevenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically experienced, and are currently experiencing. We have also\nexperienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the\nre-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of\nour intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we\nanticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and\nif the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of\nour revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. As a result, our operating results may be harmed.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which\nmay be time-consuming and expensive, or affect the freedom to operate our business.\nOur competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that\ncould prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make\nit more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their\nrights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could\nresult in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.\nIn addition, the effective protection for our brands, technologies, and proprietary information may be limited or unavailable\nin certain countries, making it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. Although we\nmake reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, we cannot guarantee that these actions will\ndeter or prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and\nconfidential information could affect our competitive position.\nWhile we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our\nstrategic initiatives in these circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the\nportions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by\nthird parties. Accordingly, we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no\nassurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses\nand associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. Further, if we are determined to have or believe there\nis a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making,\nselling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages\nand/or license royalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products\nand services. In the event that we are required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and\noperating results may be harmed.\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company’s ESG practices may result\nin additional costs or risks.\nCompanies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance\n(ESG) practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also\nincreasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their\ninvestments.
