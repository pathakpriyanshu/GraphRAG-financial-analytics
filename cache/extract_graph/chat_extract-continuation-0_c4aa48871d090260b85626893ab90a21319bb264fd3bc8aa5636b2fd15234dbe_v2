For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are\ndesigned with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their\nfunctionality. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information\ntechnology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future,\nto gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our\nproducts’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our\nproducts. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability\nreporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any\nvulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or\ngovernment investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or\ndata, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked,\nmay harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past.\nOur business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\nIt is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in\nhigher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S.\nmandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights\nwith respect to the relevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for\nour employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union\nsignatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such\nunions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do\nso in the future. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of\nour employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers\nand trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale\nof our products and may harm our business and operating results.\nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our\nvehicles have resulted from various hardware and software-related safety or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls\ninitiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may\ncompel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we\ndisagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate\nrecalls or field actions if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with\napplicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or provide certain functionalities. Such\nrecalls or field actions, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or\nour suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand,\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers. We also provide\ncertain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and\nmaintenance. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’\nwarranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components. As part of our energy\ngeneration and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the\nunderlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the\ncontract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls,\nincluding in some cases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in\nthe event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.\n21\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n25/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and\noperating results may be harmed.
