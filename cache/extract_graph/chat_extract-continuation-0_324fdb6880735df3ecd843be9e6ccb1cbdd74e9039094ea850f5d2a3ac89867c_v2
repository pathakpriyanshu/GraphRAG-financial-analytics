In addition, as we have increased our operations, we are and may\ncontinue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against.\nIf we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to\nattract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to\nthe supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in\ncountries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are\noften materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and\nsystems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles\nby foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems\nrequirements.\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features that today assist drivers\nwith certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in\nthe driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) technology. There are a variety of\ninternational, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale,\nmarketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), and future capability, including autonomous vehicles that\nmay not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to\nvehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations, including their enforcement or the enforcement policy\nassociated with the regulations, continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or\nconflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could\nadversely affect our business.\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a\nsupplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a\nprovider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies\nconcerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage\nequipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are\nintroduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and\nenergy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services,\nthreaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the\nrelevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or\ninternational privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use,\nretention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against\nus, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational\nchanges may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by\ncustomers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and\ndefense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application\nand impact, and may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs,\nadversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our\nreputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from\nindividuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines\nfor noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific\ndata privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use\nand processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have\ncome into effect in China, and other jurisdictions where Tesla has a market presence.\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and\nchanging requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance\ncould result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n25\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n29/116\n\n\f3/21\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a global manufacturer of electric vehicles, solar generation systems, energy storage systems, and provider of grid services through virtual power plant models.
