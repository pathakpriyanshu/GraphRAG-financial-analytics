Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. On January 30, 2024, the\nCourt issued an opinion finding that the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be rescinded. Plaintiff’s counsel filed a brief\nseeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla opposed the fee request, and at Tesla’s 2024\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders, 72% of the disinterested voting shares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk and Kimbal\nMusk, voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Because Tesla’s disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO\nPerformance Award, Mr. Musk and the other director defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking to revise the Court’s January\n30, 2024 opinion. On December 2, 2024, the Court issued an opinion denying the motion to revise the Court’s January 30, 2024\nopinion and awarded Plaintiff’s counsel fees in the amount of $345 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court, and the\ndirector defendants and Tesla appealed the decisions to the Delaware Supreme Court.\nLitigation Related to Directors’ Compensation\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on\nbehalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors,\nother than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and\nseeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an\nadmission of any wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed\nsettlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023,\nafter which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels’ fee request under advisement. On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the\nsettlement and awarded Plaintiff’s counsel fees in the amount of approximately $176 million. A final judgment was entered by the\nCourt on January 13, 2025. Tesla intends to appeal the Court’s fee award on or before the appeal deadline of February 12, 2025.\nThe settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon\nMusk in connection with Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16,\n2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and\nadded as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the\nfederal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of\nstockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury\nrendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a\nmotion for new trial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On November 6,\n2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of all claims.\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery,\npurportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in\nrelation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging\nadditional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Several of those actions were consolidated, and all have been stayed. In\naddition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then\nconstituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed.\n85\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n92/116\n\n\f3/21/25\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is an electric vehicle and clean energy company involved in multiple legal proceedings, including disputes over CEO compensation, directors' compensation, and a potential going private transaction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELON MUSK<|>PERSON<|>Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and a central figure in multiple legal disputes, including the 2018 CEO Performance Award and the potential going private transaction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIMBAL MUSK<|>PERSON<|>Kimbal Musk is a Tesla board member and a shareholder whose shares were excluded from disinterested voting in the 2018 CEO Performance Award ratification)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY<|>GEO<|>The Delaware Court of Chancery is a judicial body handling corporate disputes, including Tesla's litigation over CEO and directors' compensation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT<|>GEO<|>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is a federal court that affirmed the dismissal of claims related to Tesla's potential going private transaction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2018 CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD<|>EVENT<|>The 2018 CEO Performance Award is a stock-based compensation plan for Elon Musk, which was challenged in court and later ratified by Tesla's disinterested stockholders)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2024 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS<|>EVENT<|>Tesla's 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders involved voting to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTORS’ COMPENSATION LITIGATION<|>EVENT<|>Litigation concerning compensation awards granted to Tesla's directors between 2017 and 2020, resulting in a settlement approved in January 2025)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTION LITIGATION<|>EVENT<|>Litigation stemming from Elon Musk's 2018 Twitter post about taking Tesla private, which resulted in a jury verdict favoring Tesla and its board)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>ELON MUSK<|>Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and a key figure in multiple legal disputes involving the company<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY<|>The Delaware Court of Chancery is handling multiple lawsuits involving Tesla, including disputes over CEO and directors' compensation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT<|>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of claims related to Tesla's potential going private transaction<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>2018 CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD<|>Tesla's 2018 CEO Performance Award for Elon Musk was challenged in court and later ratified by disinterested stockholders<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>2024 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS<|>Tesla's 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders ratified the 2018 CEO Performance Award<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>DIRECTORS’ COMPENSATION LITIGATION<|>Tesla was involved in litigation over directors' compensation between 2017 and 2020, which resulted in a settlement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTION LITIGATION<|>Tesla faced litigation over Elon Musk's 2018 Twitter post about taking the company private, which ended in a jury verdict favoring Tesla<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELON MUSK<|>2018 CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD<|>Elon Musk was the recipient of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, which was challenged in court<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELON MUSK<|>GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTION LITIGATION<|>Elon Musk's 2018 Twitter post about taking Tesla private was central to the litigation<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIMBAL MUSK<|>2018 CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD<|>Kimbal Musk's shares were excluded from disinterested voting in the ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY<|>2018 CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD<|>The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled on the rescission of the 2018 CEO Performance Award<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY<|>DIRECTORS’ COMPENSATION LITIGATION<|>The Delaware Court of Chancery oversaw the litigation and settlement regarding Tesla's directors' compensation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT<|>GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTION LITIGATION<|>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of claims related to Tesla's going private transaction<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
