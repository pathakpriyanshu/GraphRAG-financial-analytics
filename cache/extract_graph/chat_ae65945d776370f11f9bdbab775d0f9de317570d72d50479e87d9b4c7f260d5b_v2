We had $5.00 billion of unused committed credit amounts as of December 31, 2024.

Our operating cash\ninflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from\nsales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products, and interest income on our cash and investments portfolio.\nThese cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process,\noperating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.\n42\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n46/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.67 billion to $14.92 billion during the year ended December 31,\n2024 from $13.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to favorable changes in net\noperating assets and liabilities of $2.29 billion, partially offset by a decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and\nlosses of $623 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures,\nwhich were $11.34 billion and $8.90 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, mainly for AI-related\ncapital expenditures, global factory expansion and machinery and equipment as we expand and enhance our product roadmap. We\nalso purchased $7.45 billion and $6.62 billion of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities increased by $1.26 billion to $3.85 billion during the year ended December 31,\n2024 from $2.59 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $1.81 billion increase in\nproceeds from issuances of debt, partially offset by a $1.15 billion increase in repayments of debt. See Note 10, Debt, to the\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt\nobligations.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of\nrevenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in\nrelation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign\nsubsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically\nhedge foreign currency risk.\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the\nsettlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency\n(primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that\nadverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term.
