Other applicable laws, both current and proposed, may hinder or complicate the path and timeline to introducing selfdriving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.\nOther key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ\nmaterially from the U.S. and ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or\nprevent certain features.\n8\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n12/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\nIn the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor\nvehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the\nlaws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that\nthey otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of\nstates where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened\n“galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used\nadministrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new\nlocations. Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or\nenact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations. We expect such\nchallenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.\nBattery Safety and Testing\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,”\ndefined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our\ncompliance with such regulations.\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and\ndisposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add\nadditional requirements in the future. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery\npacks, and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.\nSolar Energy—General\nWe are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of\nelectricity. To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity\nand non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and\njurisdictions.\nSolar Energy—Net Metering\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically\nallows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by\nreceiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions,\nregulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so.\nCompetition\nAutomotive\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future\nas a significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered,\nor are reported to have plans to enter the electric vehicle market.\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their\npropulsion technology. For example, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with\npremium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs,\nall of which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more\nestablished automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have\nannounced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and\nvehicle introductions promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles\nrelative to internal combustion vehicles. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major\nmarkets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing\nelectric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.\n9\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n13/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving\ntechnologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through\ncontinued progress on our Autopilot, FSD (Supervised) and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our\ninfotainment offerings.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Systems\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1db949697b4eb71cb95e386e83fff4c7c445bfe890f660d7cd3fd14d86e54626_v2"}
