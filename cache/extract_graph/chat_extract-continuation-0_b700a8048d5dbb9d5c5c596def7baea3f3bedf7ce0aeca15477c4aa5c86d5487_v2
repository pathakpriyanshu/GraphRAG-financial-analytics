BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage\nsystems, and offer services related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our\ncustomer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops,\nSupercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance,\nattractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to\ndevelop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through\ncontinuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our\nengineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\nSegment Information\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully\nelectric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and\nother, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging,\ninsurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design,\nmanufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of\nsolar energy systems incentives.\nOur Products and Services\nAutomotive\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door\nmid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility\nvehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and\nModel X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance\ncharacteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we entered the consumer\npickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has\nthe utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned\nelectric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving\n(“FSD”) (Supervised) features, including through our purpose-built Robotaxi product - Cybercab, and battery cell and other\ntechnologies. For purposes of this filing, use of the term “FSD (Supervised)” includes the equivalent naming convention, “FSD\n(Capability)” that is used in the European, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Products\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to\ncustomers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an\nenergy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped\ntogether to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater capacity.\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems\nacross a wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\n2\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n6/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSolar Energy Offerings\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit\nsolar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture\ncertain components for our solar energy products.\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, to consumers, including through\nchannel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real\nestate developers and builders on new homes.\nTechnology\nAutomotive\nBattery and Powertrain\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design\nvehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be\nadaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor\npowertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as\nwell as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of\nModel S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body\nof knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for\nour products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved\nmanufacturing processes.\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software.
