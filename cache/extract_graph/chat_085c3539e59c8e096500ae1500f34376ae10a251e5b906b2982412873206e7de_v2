Many of our competitors have significantly more or\nbetter-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and\nsupport of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls,\nloss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n16\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n20/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and\nservice providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. In addition, decreases in the retail or wholesale\nprices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead\nto an increased rate of customer defaults.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may\nharm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithiumion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle\ncomponents at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If\nwe are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or\nhire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm\nour business and operating results.\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are\nstored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such\nfacilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety\nissue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\nWe face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and\nuncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions\nin numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which\nare inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., with additional\nmanufacturing operations in China and Europe, create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety\nrequirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing\nforeign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\nenforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and\npreferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a\nglobal basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s multijurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability\nto sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them\neffectively.\nOur business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than\nexpected to become fully functional.\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to\nperform as designed or intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD\n(Supervised) features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation,\nour ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product\nrecalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection claims and significant warranty and\nother expenses. While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products’ capability and performance, there is no\nguarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in\ninitial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Although we\nattempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may\nhamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal\ntesting on our products and features, though, like the rest of the industry, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which\nto evaluate certain aspects of their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics, including exposure to or\nconsequence of external attacks. While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-production and sale,\nthere may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to\nor installation for customers.\n17\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n21/116\n\n\f3/21\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_085c3539e59c8e096500ae1500f34376ae10a251e5b906b2982412873206e7de_v2"}
