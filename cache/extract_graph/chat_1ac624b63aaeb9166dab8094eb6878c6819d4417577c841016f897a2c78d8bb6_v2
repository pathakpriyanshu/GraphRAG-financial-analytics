The automotive\nsegment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive\nregulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes sales of used\nvehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail\nmerchandise sales. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of\nsolar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\nOur CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information. The CODM uses gross profit to\nallocate operating and capital resources and assesses performance of each segment by comparing actual gross profit results to\nhistorical results and previously forecasted financial information.
