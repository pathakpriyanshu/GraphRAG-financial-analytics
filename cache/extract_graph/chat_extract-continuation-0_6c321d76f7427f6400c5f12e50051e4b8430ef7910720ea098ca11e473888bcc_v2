As these product\nlines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products. At the same time, changes in\ngovernment and economic incentives or tariffs may also impact our sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape.\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core\nprojects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously\ndeveloping and ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development\nand manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other\nartificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority\namong projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased\ncapital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced\nprojects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our\ncapital expenditures to exceed $11.00 billion in 2025 and in each of the following two fiscal years.\nOur business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend,\nand with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales\ngrowth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other\nthings, to invest in autonomy, do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our\ncustomers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the\nspecific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply\nchain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to\nbe self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n34\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n38/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\n(“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in\nthe accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly\nfrom the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that\nthere are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee\narrangements, sales return reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income tax, the collectability of accounts and finance\nreceivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value\nand residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the\nimpact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or\nmaterially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThese estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from\nthese estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other\nfeatures and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue\nfrom Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), including access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance,\ninternet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales\nupon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control\ntransfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected\nover the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for\nexpected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as\naccess to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control\ntransfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services\nto the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is\nearlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the\nexpected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered\nto the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate\nstandalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and\nother information that may be available.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a global company involved in manufacturing electric vehicles, energy storage products, and developing autonomous and artificial intelligence-enabled technologies.
