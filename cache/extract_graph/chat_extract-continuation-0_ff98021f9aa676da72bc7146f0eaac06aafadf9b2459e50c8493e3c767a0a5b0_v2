Complying with emerging and\nchanging requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance\ncould result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n25\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n29/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer\nobligations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our\ninternational operations. Risks and penalties could include ongoing audit requirements, data protection authority investigations,\nlegal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other\ncommercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal\ninformation, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third\nparties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to\nthe personal information we process and handle. A major breach of our network security and systems may occur despite defensive\nmeasures, and may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain\ngovernmental investigations and proceedings.\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government\nagency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome\nor impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other\nrestrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to\npursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and\nsubpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\nWe may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not\nbe able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose\nlimitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain\ndealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators\npermitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions\ncomply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have\nreinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise\ndealers anywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to\npropose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few\nstates have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can\nobtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we\nhave entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this\narea can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles\ninterfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an\nintra-day trading high of $488.54 per share and a low of $138.80 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for\ntechnology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been\nhistorically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common\nstock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside\nof our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public\nattention, regardless of actual operating performance.
