Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits\nearned.\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with\ndirect sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with\nproviding non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs\nto provide vehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\n2024 compared to 2023\nCost of automotive sales revenue decreased $3.25 billion, or 5%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily from lower raw\nmaterial costs, freight and duties as well as mix, in addition to the volume changes in deliveries year over year as discussed above.\nThe decreases were partially offset by higher costs for Cybertruck.\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $265 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower\ndeliveries and a decrease in our direct operating lease cost of revenue driven by lower lease buyouts compared to the prior periods.\nCost of services and other revenue increased $2.09 billion, or 27%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to volume increases in used vehicle sales at lower average vehicle acquisition cost,\ninsurance services, paid Supercharging, part sales and non-warranty maintenance services and collision.\nGross margin for total automotive decreased from 19.4% to 18.4% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 due to lower average selling price on our vehicles and Cybertruck ramp, partially offset by lower\naverage combined cost per unit of our vehicles and increases in regulatory credit and FSD (Supervised) revenue, as discussed\nabove.\nGross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 18.2% to 16.9% in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
