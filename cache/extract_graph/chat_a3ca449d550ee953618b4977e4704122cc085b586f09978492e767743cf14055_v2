We\ndetermine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease\ncommencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to\naccount for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor\nperspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From\na lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component\nand, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12\nmonths or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise.\nAll other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at\ncommencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate\nbased on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases\nalso include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease\nliabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such\noptions.\n75\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n81/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating\nexpenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based\non an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement\ndate for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization\nof finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the\nleased asset.
