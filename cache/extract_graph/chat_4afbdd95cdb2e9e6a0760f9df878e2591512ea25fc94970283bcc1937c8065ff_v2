Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered\nto the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate\nstandalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and\nother information that may be available.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and\nenergy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or\nobsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of\nour future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate\nsale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the\ninventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established\nand subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs\nmay be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n35\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n39/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nWarranties\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of\nthe energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for\nthe products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and\nrecalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs\nof future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause\nmaterial changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated\nwith our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to\nrepair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next\n12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we\nrecord receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses\nand other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is\nrecorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive\nbusiness, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees\nand for our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the\nstock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the\ngrant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such\nas the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant\njudgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The\nresulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,\nusually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based\ncompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance\nachievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone\nbecomes probable.\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our\ncommon stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation\nof our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based\ncompensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative\nexpense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining\nour provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred\ntax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account\nall relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider\nour history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional\nbasis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4afbdd95cdb2e9e6a0760f9df878e2591512ea25fc94970283bcc1937c8065ff_v2"}
