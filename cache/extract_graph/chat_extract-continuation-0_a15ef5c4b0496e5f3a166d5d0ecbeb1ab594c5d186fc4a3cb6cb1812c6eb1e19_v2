To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and\ncybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external thirdparty tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting,\nconduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including\nour consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected\nstages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and\nrecovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product\nSecurity, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents\nare evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals\nthen collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and\nform detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity\nprograms and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has\nbeen certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and\nmitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party\nservice providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service\nproviders and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to\nnew vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and\nmitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity\nincidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition, under the heading “Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers\nor customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual\nproperty theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse\nconsequences” included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCybersecurity Governance\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management.\nOur Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive\nupdates on a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security,\nCompliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how\nmanagement is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key\ninformation security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurityrelated news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.\n28\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n32/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product\nSecurity, Compliance and Legal teams. Such individuals have an average of over 15 years of prior work experience in various roles\ninvolving information technology, including security, auditing, compliance, systems and programming. These individuals are\ninformed about, and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their\nmanagement of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the\noperation of our incident response plan, and report to the Audit Committee on any appropriate items.\nITEM 2.
