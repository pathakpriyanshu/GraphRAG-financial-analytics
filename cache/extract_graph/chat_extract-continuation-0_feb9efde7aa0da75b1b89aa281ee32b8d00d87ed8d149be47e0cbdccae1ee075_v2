As of December 31, 2024, there were 95.5 million\nshares available for issuance under the ESPP.\nFair Value Assumptions\nWe use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate\nthe fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date\ngenerally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for\nstock options are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n\nRisk-free interest rate\nExpected term (in years)\nExpected volatility\nDividend yield\nGrant date fair value per share\n\n$\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n3.92 %\n4.3\n\n3.90 %\n4.5\n\n3.11 %\n4.1\n\n59 %\n0.0 %\n114.29\n$\n\n63 %\n0.0 %\n121.62\n$\n\n63 %\n0.0 %\n114.51\n\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the\nclosing fair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S.\nTreasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term\nof our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our\ncommon stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\n79\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n85/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nOther Performance-Based Grants\nFrom time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based\nRSUs and stock options.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $490 million under these grants to\npurchase or receive an aggregate 5.0 million shares of our common stock.
