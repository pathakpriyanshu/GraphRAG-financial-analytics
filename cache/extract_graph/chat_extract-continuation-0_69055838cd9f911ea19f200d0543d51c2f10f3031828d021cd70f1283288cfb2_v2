The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets increased by $332 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, and decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73 billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The valuation allowance increase during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the changes of our\nCalifornia deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses. The change in valuation allowance\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S.\nfederal and certain state deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative\nevidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our\nexpected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state\ndeferred tax assets are realizable and released the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance change\nduring the years ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our deferred\ntax assets without a valuation allowance are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in the\nrespective jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $4.34 billion of federal and $8.59 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards\navailable to offset future taxable income, an immaterial amount of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2026 for federal\nand 2025 for state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and\ntax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have\ndetermined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards\ndue to prior ownership changes or expirations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had federal research and development tax credits of $1.48 billion, federal renewable energy\ntax credits of $1.01 billion, and state research and development tax credits of $1.06 billion. Most of our state research and\ndevelopment tax credits were in the state of California. If not utilized, some of the federal tax credits may expire in various\namounts beginning in 2035. However, California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in\nno or minimal tax costs. We have recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For\nthe earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest, no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded.\nThe estimated amount of such unrecognized withholding tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is\napproximately $309 million.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2021\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n$\n\n531\n136\n\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\n\n(12)\n222\n(7)\n\nDecember 31, 2022\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n870\n59\n\nDecreases in balances related to settlement with tax authorities\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\n\n(6)\n255\n(4)\n\nDecember 31, 2023\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\n\n1,174\n51\n\nDecreases\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a multinational corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage, and renewable energy solutions.
