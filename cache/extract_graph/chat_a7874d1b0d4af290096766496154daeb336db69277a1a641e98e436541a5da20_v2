The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the\nparticipation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted\nprocurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self\nGeneration Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers\nmay transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy\ngeneration and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (”IRC”), standalone energy storage\ntechnology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which\nmay be claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These\ntax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\n7\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n11/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSolar Energy System Incentives and Policies\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce\nthe cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax\nabatements and rebates.\nIn particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of\nqualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems\nthey purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax\ncredits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\nRegulations\nVehicle Safety and Testing\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”),\nincluding all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS\napply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we\nexpect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions; however,\nFMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable\nFMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel\nEconomy standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in\nwriting, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign\nrecalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding certain crashes involving vehicles equipped with advanced driver\nassistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The\nU.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information\nregarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of\nfuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the\n“EPA”), and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations.\nMany of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those\nregulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features.\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on\nfeatures or vehicle designs that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to selfdriving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the\nFMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety or\ncompliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the\noperation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork\nincreases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.\nIn markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“ECE markets”), some\nrequirements restrict the design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use\nentirely. Other applicable laws, both current and proposed, may hinder or complicate the path and timeline to introducing selfdriving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.\nOther key markets, including China, continue to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a7874d1b0d4af290096766496154daeb336db69277a1a641e98e436541a5da20_v2"}
