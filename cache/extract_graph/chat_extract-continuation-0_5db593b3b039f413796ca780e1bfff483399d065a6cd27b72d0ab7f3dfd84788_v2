As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nshould be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair\nvalue hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs\nsuch as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either\ndirectly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy\nrequires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.
