The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately\non the balance sheet with changes reported in the statement of operations each reporting period. The new crypto assets standard\nalso enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units\nfor each significant crypto asset holding. The new crypto assets standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December\n15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the new crypto assets standard requires a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity\nadopts the amendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the new crypto\nassets standard is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the new crypto assets standard as of the beginning of the\nfiscal year that includes the interim period. We adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified retrospective approach\neffective January 1, 2024. Refer to Note 3, Digital Assets, Net for the inclusion of the new required disclosures. The cumulative\neffect of the changes made on our January 1, 2024 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the new crypto assets standard\nwas as follows (in millions):\nAdjustments from Adoption of\nthe New Crypto Assets\nStandard\n\nBalances at\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nAssets\nDigital assets, net\nDeferred tax assets\n\n$\n\n184\n6,733\n\n$\n\nBalances at\nJanuary 1, 2024\n\n303 $\n(67)\n\n487\n6,666\n\n236\n\n28,118\n\nStockholders' equity\nRetained earnings\n\n27,882\n\nNote 3 – Digital Assets, Net\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital assets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded an immaterial amount and $204 million of impairment losses on\ndigital assets, respectively.
