Payments\nare typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we\nfinance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on\nhistorical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar\nbuyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-theair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have\na stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based\non actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the\nperformance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is\nrecognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our\nobligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an\noffset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our\ncontract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as\nincurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have\nelected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the\ncustomer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the\ntransaction price of automotive contracts.\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs.\nUnder these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle\nto our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606.\n54\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n60/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nWe receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a\nguarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle’s contractual or determined residual value at\nthe end of the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under these\nprograms to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee liabilities. As we\naccumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to\ntheir estimated values. The total recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under these programs were immaterial as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023. Our maximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or\nabove the vehicle’s contractual residual value at the end of the lease term was $1.45 billion and $166 million as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet\nconnectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the\nfollowing (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n\nDeferred revenue — beginning of period\n\n$\n\nAdditions\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts,\nincluding foreign exchange impact\nRevenue recognized\n\n2023\n\n3,536\n1,343\n\n$\n\n(92)\n(1,188)\n\nDeferred revenue — end of period\n\n$\n\n3,599\n\n2,913\n1,201\n17\n(595)\n\n$\n\n3,536\n\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or\npartially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022 was $872 million and $469 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total deferred\nrevenue balance as of December 31, 2024, we expect to recognize $840 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining\nbalance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in\nAutomotive Sales.\nWe have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our automotive\ndeliveries. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $247 million and $242 million,\nrespectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $821 million and $1.04 billion, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the longterm portion.\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse\ngas, fuel economy and clean fuel.
