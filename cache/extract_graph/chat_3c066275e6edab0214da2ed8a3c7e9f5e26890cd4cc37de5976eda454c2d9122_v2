As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nshould be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair\nvalue hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs\nsuch as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either\ndirectly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy\nrequires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at\nfair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2024\nFair Value\n\nLevel I\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nLevel II\n\nLevel III\n\nFair Value\n\nLevel I\n\nLevel II\n\nLevel III\n\nCertificates of deposit and\ntime deposits\n$\n\n12,767\n\nCommercial paper\n\n3,919\n\n—\n\n3,919\n\n—\n\n470\n\n—\n\n470\n\n—\n\nU.S. government\nsecurities\n\n3,620\n\n—\n\n3,620\n\n—\n\n5,136\n\n—\n\n5,136\n\n—\n\n118\n\n—\n\n118\n\n—\n\n480\n\n—\n\n480\n\n—\n\nMoney market funds\n\n1,753\n\n1,753\n\n—\n\n—\n\n109\n\n109\n\n—\n\n—\n\nDigital assets\n\n1,076\n\n1,076\n\n—\n\n—\n\nCorporate debt securities\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n23,253\n\n$\n\n$\n\n—\n\n2,829\n\n$\n\n$\n\n12,767\n\n20,424\n\n$\n\n—\n\n$\n\n—\n\n$\n\n6,996\n\n$\n\n—\n\n$\n\n6,996\n\n$\n\n—\n\nNot applicable\n$\n\n13,191\n\n$\n\n109\n\n$\n\n13,082\n\n$\n\n—\n\nAll of our money market funds and digital assets are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were\nvalued using quoted prices in active markets.
