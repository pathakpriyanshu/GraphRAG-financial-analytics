The\ndifference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have\ndetermined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized\nbased on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria\nare met.\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of\nrevenue recognized, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2024\nand 2023, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $164 million and $181 million, respectively. Deferred\nrevenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government\nagencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue from rebates\nand incentives was immaterial.\n57\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n63/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the\nreferral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the\nterm of the related agreements.\nCost of Revenues\nAutomotive Segment\nAutomotive Sales\nCost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including\ndepreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD (Supervised) ongoing\nmaintenance costs, electricity costs for our free Supercharging programs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of\nautomotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our\ninventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of\nforecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to\n$625 million and $359 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAutomotive Leasing\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with\ndirect sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\nServices and Other\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with\nproviding non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs\nto provide vehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead,\nincluding depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation\nand storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net\nrealizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy\ngeneration and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $756 million and $115 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor,\nthe cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated\nwith those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and\nliability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial\nstatement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to\naffect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to\nbe realized.\n58\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n64/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and\nany valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the\nrealizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our\nassessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss)\nadjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to\nstock-based compensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences.
