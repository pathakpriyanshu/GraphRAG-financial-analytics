CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes\nthat any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\nthe desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are\nresource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and\nprocedures relative to their costs.\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31,\n2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide\nreasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n91\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n98/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2024.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,\n2024, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone of the Company’s directors or officers adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a nonRule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, as such terms are defined under\nItem 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except as follows:\nOn December 6, 2024, Ira Ehrenpreis, one of our directors, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement for the potential\nexercise of options to purchase 761,961 shares of our common stock, and the subsequent sale of our common stock subject to\ncertain conditions, in amounts sufficient to cover tax withholding obligations and yield aggregate net proceeds to Mr. Ehrenpreis of\n$15 million, after payment of commissions and fees.
