This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the\ndeployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us\nagainst intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our\nsystems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks,\nphishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities,\nbreakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security\nincidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss,\ndestruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or\nvehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us\nto comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation,\nregulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or\notherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and\nsecurity of personal information.

These\nrisks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service\nproducts, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under,\ntax laws and other applicable regulations.\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be\ndisrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our\ninternal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary\ninformation, including intellectual property and personal information, could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation\nmay be adversely affected.
