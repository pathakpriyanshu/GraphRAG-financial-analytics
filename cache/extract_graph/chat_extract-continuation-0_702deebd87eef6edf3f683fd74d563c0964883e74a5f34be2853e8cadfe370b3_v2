For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we\nrecord receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses\nand other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is\nrecorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive\nbusiness, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the\nfollowing (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n\nAccrued warranty—beginning of period\n\n$\n\nWarranty costs incurred\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations\nand foreign exchange impact\nProvision for warranty\nAccrued warranty—end of period\n\n$\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n5,152 $\n(1,453)\n\n3,505 $\n(1,225)\n\n2,101\n(803)\n\n287\n\n539\n\n522\n\n2,730\n\n2,333\n\n1,685\n\n6,716\n\n$\n\n5,152\n\n$\n\n3,505\n\n65\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n71/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nCustomer Deposits\nCustomer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or\nreservation for a vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of\ninstallation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as\nvehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets until\nrefunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer’s purchase balance.\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements.\nGovernment incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of\nexpense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive\nhave been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt.\nThe IRA Incentives\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022.\nThe IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or\npurchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations\nwith profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a reduction of our costs of\nrevenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nGigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under\nthe lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are\nrequired to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement,\nthe SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and\ncommissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of\nsuch amount (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility\nwithin the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of\noperations and was not material for any period presented.\nGigafactory Shanghai—Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms\nof the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the\nend of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used\nin connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies).\nIncentives that offset costs of our facilities are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property,\nplant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and incentives related to our manufacturing operations are\nrecorded as an offset to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023, the amounts received were immaterial.\nNevada Tax Incentives\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements in 2014 with the State of Nevada\nand Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable\ntax credits of up to $195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.\n66\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n72/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nGigafactory\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GIGAFACTORY NEW YORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gigafactory New York is a manufacturing facility leased through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation, supported by New York State investment and lease agreements, with hiring and cumulative investment targets<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNY FOUNDATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The SUNY Foundation is involved in the lease and investment agreements for Gigafactory New York, funding a majority of construction costs and manufacturing equipment<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIGAFACTORY SHANGHAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gigafactory Shanghai is a manufacturing facility in Shanghai, China, operating under agreements with the local government for land use rights and economic benefits, including capital expenditure and tax revenue targets<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANGHAI GOVERNMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Shanghai government provides land use rights and economic incentives to Gigafactory Shanghai for eligible capital investments<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIGAFACTORY NEVADA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gigafactory Nevada is a manufacturing facility benefiting from tax abatements, energy rate discounts, and transferable tax credits under agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE OF NEVADA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The State of Nevada provides tax incentives and energy rate discounts to Gigafactory Nevada in exchange for capital investment and hiring targets<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOREY COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Storey County in Nevada is involved in agreements providing tax abatements and incentives to Gigafactory Nevada<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRA<|>EVENT<|>The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) enacted in 2022 promotes clean energy, electric vehicles, and battery manufacturing, impacting corporate taxes and providing incentives that reduce costs for companies<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIGAFACTORY NEW YORK<|>SUNY FOUNDATION<|>The SUNY Foundation funds construction and equipment costs for Gigafactory New York under a lease agreement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIGAFACTORY SHANGHAI<|>SHANGHAI GOVERNMENT<|>The Shanghai government provides land use rights and economic incentives to Gigafactory Shanghai<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIGAFACTORY NEVADA<|>STATE OF NEVADA<|>The State of Nevada provides tax abatements and energy rate discounts to Gigafactory Nevada<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIGAFACTORY NEVADA<|>STOREY COUNTY<|>Storey County collaborates with the State of Nevada to provide tax incentives to Gigafactory Nevada<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRA<|>GIGAFACTORY NEW YORK<|>The IRA incentives promote clean energy and reduce costs for facilities like Gigafactory New York<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRA<|>GIGAFACTORY SHANGHAI<|>The IRA incentives promote clean energy and reduce costs for facilities like Gigafactory Shanghai<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRA<|>GIGAFACTORY NEVADA<|>The IRA incentives promote clean energy and reduce costs for facilities like Gigafactory Nevada<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
