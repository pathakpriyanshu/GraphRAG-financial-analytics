We also have audited the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position\nof the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in\nthe period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAlso in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for digital\nassets in 2024.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control\nover financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express\nopinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based\non our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.\nOur audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n46\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n50/116\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_bff22cf86e41d9ca5cab87a733cef2bdba2995672c5557c9eb912e89eb370c96_v2"}
