As of\nDecember 31, 2024, and 2023, we have accrued $69 million and $47 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on our\nunrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $1.14 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the\nInternal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018.

On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these\nspecified investment and job creation requirements, it may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of “program\npayments” which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at\nGigafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.\nIn 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital,\noperational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed\nfrom time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations.\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use\nrights where we have been constructing Gigafactory Shanghai.
