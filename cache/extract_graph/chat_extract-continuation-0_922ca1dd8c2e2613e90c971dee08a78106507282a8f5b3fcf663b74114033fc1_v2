The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If\nwe are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling\nalternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to\ngrow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot\neffectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk.\n18\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n22/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSimilarly, we have provided residual value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs,\nunder which such counterparties may sell their vehicles through various remarketing channels. However, actual resale values are\nsubject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from one or more of the factors discussed above. If the\nactual resale values of any vehicles resold by our vehicle customers and partners are lower than the residual values we have agreed\nto with them, the residual value guarantees may be triggered and, as a result, our financial condition and operating results may be\nharmed.\nFinally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to\ncustomer credit risk. In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or\nunwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we\nmay incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets.\nWe must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of\nNew York relating to our Gigafactory New York.\nWe are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the\n“SUNY Foundation”). These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have\nprimarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage\ncomponents and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to,\namong other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in\nBuffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs\nin the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2024, we have\nmet and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our\ncurrent and anticipated level of operations. While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and\nthe surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable\nfuture obligations may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of “program payments” which would not be expected\nto have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York, and/or the need\nto adjust certain of our operations. Any of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed.\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations\nor delay the development, introduction and ramp of our products and services. In particular, we are highly dependent on the\nservices of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an\nemployment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary\nto grow our business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and retain a large number of engineering,\nmanufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to support our\nplanned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations. If we are not successful in\nmanaging these risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nEmployees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor\nmarket for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In regions where\nwe have or will have operations, particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for\nindividuals with skillsets needed for our business, including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical\nand building construction expertise. We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial\nresources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities.\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based\nawards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek\nand obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and\nemployee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may\nhave to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed.\n19\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/131\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tesla is a leading electric vehicle and clean energy company that operates vehicle leasing, solar energy system financing, and energy storage sales programs, among other initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELON MUSK<|>PERSON<|>Elon Musk is the Technoking of Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer, playing a critical role in the company's operations and growth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIGAFACTORY NEW YORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gigafactory New York is a Tesla facility used for the development and production of Solar Roofs, solar products, energy storage components, and Supercharger components, located in Buffalo, New York)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNY FOUNDATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Research Foundation for the State University of New York, which is party to an operating lease and research agreement with Tesla for the construction and use of Gigafactory New York)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUFFALO<|>GEO<|>Buffalo is a city in New York where Tesla's Gigafactory New York is located and where Tesla has employment obligations under its agreement with the SUNY Foundation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE OF NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>The State of New York is the region where Tesla has committed to spending $5 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, and other costs under its agreement with the SUNY Foundation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOLAR ROOF<|>EVENT<|>Solar Roof is a Tesla product developed and produced at Gigafactory New York, contributing to the company's clean energy initiatives)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>ELON MUSK<|>Elon Musk is the Chief Executive Officer and Technoking of Tesla, playing a pivotal role in the company's leadership and operations<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>GIGAFACTORY NEW YORK<|>Tesla operates Gigafactory New York for the production of solar products, energy storage components, and Supercharger components<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>SUNY FOUNDATION<|>Tesla has an agreement with the SUNY Foundation for the construction and operation of Gigafactory New York<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>BUFFALO<|>Tesla has employment obligations in Buffalo, New York, as part of its agreement with the SUNY Foundation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>STATE OF NEW YORK<|>Tesla has committed to spending $5 billion in the State of New York under its agreement with the SUNY Foundation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIGAFACTORY NEW YORK<|>SOLAR ROOF<|>Gigafactory New York is the primary facility for the development and production of Tesla's Solar Roof<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUNY FOUNDATION<|>STATE OF NEW YORK<|>The SUNY Foundation is a key partner in Tesla's operations in the State of New York through its agreement for Gigafactory New York<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUFFALO<|>STATE OF NEW YORK<|>Buffalo is a city within the State of New York where Tesla's Gigafactory New York is located<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
