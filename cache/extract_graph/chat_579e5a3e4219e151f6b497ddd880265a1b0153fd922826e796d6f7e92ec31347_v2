However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to\nvolatility from time to time.\n4\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n8/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUsed Vehicle Sales\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla\nvehicle with the sale of a new Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins, along with vehicles returned\nupon lease-end are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties.\nPublic Charging\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers.\nWhere possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable\npower. Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle\nowners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger\nnetwork either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer\nSupercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to\nsustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American\nCharging Standard (NACS). This enables electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier\nand more efficient for everyone and advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this,\nall major automotive companies announced their adoption of NACS in certain markets, with their access to the Supercharger\nnetwork beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no later than 2025. We also engaged SAE\nInternational to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our network of\nTesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting\nemployees, to offer additional charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family\nresidential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\nIn-App Upgrades\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and\nfeatures through the Tesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer\ncertain options and features on a subscription basis in the future.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities\nthrough a variety of channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel\npartners, and in the case of some commercial customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and\naccessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\nService and Warranty\nAutomotive\nService\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service\ntechnicians who perform work remotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to\nidentify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer\nnetworks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively.\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\nWe provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to consumers, which may\ninclude limited warranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer\noptional extended service plans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified\nregions.\n5\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n9/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nWe provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally\nprovide manufacturer’s limited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that are\navailable at the time of purchase of the system. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation\nworkmanship.\nFor retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for\nSolar Roof, we also provide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we\ngenerally pass-through the applicable manufacturers’ warranties.\nAs part of our historical solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance\nguarantees that commit that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance\nrequirements specified in the contract.\nFinancial Services\nAutomotive\nPurchase Financing and Leases\nWe offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe\nand/or Asia ourselves and through various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value\nguarantees or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to cover a resale\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_579e5a3e4219e151f6b497ddd880265a1b0153fd922826e796d6f7e92ec31347_v2"}
