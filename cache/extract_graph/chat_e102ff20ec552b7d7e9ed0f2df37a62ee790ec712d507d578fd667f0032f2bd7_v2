Additionally, in 2024, we fully\nsettled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 11.4 million shares\nof our common stock.\nCredit Agreement\nIn January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a\nsyndicate of banks. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to\n$5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used\nfor general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our\nelection, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for\nloans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated\nin euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will\nbe based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to time. The fee\nfor undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.125% per annum.\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes\nFrom time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related to certain vehicles (either leased or financed)\ninto special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors.\nThe SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the\nprincipal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is\ndistributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease or financing contracts in\naccordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the\ncreditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\nIn 2024, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles and/or financing receivables into SPEs and\nissued $2.45 billion in aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other previously\nissued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $2.44 billion.\nEnergy Asset-backed Notes\nIn 2024, we transferred certain financing receivables into an SPE and issued $499 million in aggregate principal amount of\nEnergy Asset-backed Notes, backed by these financing receivables. The proceeds from issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were\n$494 million. The SPE is wholly owned by us and is consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these\nfinancing receivables are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Energy Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the\nSPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPE’s assets and cash flows are not available to our other\ncreditors, and the creditors of the SPE, including the Energy Asset-backed Notes holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\nCash Equity Debt\nIn connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate\nprincipal amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain\nfinancing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.\n74\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n\n80/116\n\n\f3/21/25, 5:37 PM\n\ntsla-20241231\n\nChina Working Capital Facility\nIn April 2024, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the “China Working Capital Facility”) with lenders in\nChina for an unsecured revolving facility of up to RMB 20.00 billion to be used for certain production expenditures as well as\nrepayment of certain finance facilities. Borrowed funds bear interest at a rate equal to the Loan Prime Rate published by the\nPeople’s Bank of China minus 1.18%. The China Working Capital Facility is non-recourse to our assets.\nPledged Assets\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had pledged or restricted $5.16 billion and $4.64 billion of our assets (consisting\nprincipally of operating lease vehicles, financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for\nour outstanding debt.\nSchedule of Principal Maturities of Debt\nThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2024 were as follows (in millions):\nRecourse debt\n\n2025\n\n$\n\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\n\nNon-recourse debt\n\n4\n\n$\n\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n7\n\n2,349\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n4,116\n699\n243\n95\n398\n$\n\n7,900\n\n2,353\n4,116\n699\n243\n95\n401\n\n$\n\n7,907\n\nNote 11 – Leases\nWe have entered into various\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e102ff20ec552b7d7e9ed0f2df37a62ee790ec712d507d578fd667f0032f2bd7_v2"}
