During this period, demand for Tesla's automotive regulatory credits increased substantially, driven by other manufacturers scaling back their electric vehicle plans. This heightened demand for regulatory credits highlights North America's evolving automotive landscape and Tesla's pivotal role in supporting the transition to sustainable transportation.\n\nIn addition to regulatory credits, Tesla provides leasing and loan financing arrangements for its vehicles in North America. These financial options make Tesla's electric vehicles more accessible to a broader range of customers, further solidifying the region as a key market for the company.
