Tesla records deferred revenue from various sources, including customer payments, rebates, and incentives, as well as prepayments for energy products and services. This deferred revenue represents payments received in advance for goods or services that have not yet been fully delivered or obligations that have not been fulfilled. Tesla systematically recognizes this revenue over the duration of the associated contract or lease term, ensuring compliance with accounting standards and reflecting the gradual fulfillment of its commitments. For energy products and services, deferred revenue is specifically recognized as revenue once Tesla has completed its obligations, such as delivering the product or providing the agreed-upon service. This approach underscores Tesla's commitment to accurate financial reporting and its focus on aligning revenue recognition with the completion of contractual responsibilities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1750848589, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
