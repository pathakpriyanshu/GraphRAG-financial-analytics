While under development, the system requires human oversight to ensure safe operation, making it a driver-assistance feature rather than fully autonomous technology. FSD (Supervised) is part of Tesla's broader efforts to advance self-driving technology, incorporating features such as internet connectivity, ongoing maintenance, and over-the-air software updates to improve performance and functionality over time.\n\nThe software has been a significant contributor to Tesla's automotive sales revenue, generating $596 million in 2024 following the release of certain features. It is also included in Tesla's ecosystem of services, which may involve free Supercharging programs for customers. Despite its innovative approach, FSD (Supervised) has faced public attention and regulatory scrutiny due to accidents and allegations of misrepresentation regarding its capabilities. Tesla continues to refine the technology, aiming to balance its promise of autonomous driving with the need for human supervision to ensure safety.\n\nFSD (Supervised) represents a key milestone in Tesla's pursuit of self-driving technology, offering customers advanced driver-assistance functionalities while remaining a work in progress.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1750848485, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 430, "total_tokens": 672, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
