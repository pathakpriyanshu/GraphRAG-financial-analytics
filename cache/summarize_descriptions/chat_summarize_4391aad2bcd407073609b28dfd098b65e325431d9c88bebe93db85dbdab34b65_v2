In 2022, Tesla opened NACS to the broader industry to promote interoperability between electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations, enabling seamless integration across different manufacturers and charging networks. The standard has since gained significant traction, with major automotive companies adopting it as a preferred charging protocol. This adoption has led to agreements between Tesla and other manufacturers, allowing non-Tesla EVs to access Tesla's extensive Supercharger network, further enhancing charging accessibility for EV owners.\n\nNACS is now governed by SAE International under the designation J3400, ensuring its standardization and widespread implementation across the industry.
