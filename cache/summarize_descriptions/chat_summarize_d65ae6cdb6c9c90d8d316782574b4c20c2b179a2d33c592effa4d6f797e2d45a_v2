Additionally, Automotive Leasing accounts for associated costs such as depreciation, warranty expenses, and other financial considerations tied to the leased vehicles.\n\nIn 2024, Tesla's Automotive Leasing revenue experienced a notable decrease of $293 million. This decline was attributed to a strategic shift toward commercial banking partner programs, which altered the structure and focus of Tesla's leasing operations.
