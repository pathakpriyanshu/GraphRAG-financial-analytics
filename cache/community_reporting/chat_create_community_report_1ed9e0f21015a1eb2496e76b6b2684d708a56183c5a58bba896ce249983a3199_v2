In the context of Tesla, operating leases encompass two distinct applications. First, Tesla leases assets such as vehicles and solar energy systems to customers, allowing them to use these products while making payments over a specified period. This arrangement enables customers to access Tesla's innovative technologies without the need for upfront ownership, spreading costs over time.\n\nSecond, Tesla utilizes operating leases for its own operational needs, such as leasing offices and equipment. In these cases, Tesla does not own the leased assets but instead recognizes lease expenses over the lease term. This approach allows Tesla to manage its operational costs effectively while maintaining flexibility in its use of facilities and equipment.\n\nIn summary, operating leases serve dual purposes for Tesla: they provide a payment-based access model for customers to use Tesla's products, and they enable Tesla to utilize essential assets for its operations without direct ownership.\",7\r\n535,FINANCE LEASES,\"Finance leases are long-term leasing arrangements utilized by Tesla to finance specific assets, including solar energy systems, property, plant, and equipment.
